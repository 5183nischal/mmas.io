As an immediate attempt to contradict the title, I will start by saying that there are many questions concerning engineering. But to build on Heidegger's vocabulary, the question concerning enginnering would be that of it's essence. 

Technology, Heidegger claims must be understood as “a way of revealing”. There's much, and often obscure philosophy that builds up to the preceding claim, but we can understand it by using an example. *Modern* technology, for example Heidegger concludes, reveals the world as raw material, available to humans for production and manipulation, and that is the essence of modern technology. This is a valid but incomplete conclusion and trying to grapple with the question concerning engineering can take us further. This essay will refer to and build on ideas from the first essay in the series.

For Heidegger, technology is a way of revealing the world through our relation with the world. But the relation that we have with the world is not static. It changes with our intention and goals. It changes with what's accessible to us and what's not. We could ask: What is our current intentions and goals in regards to engagement with the world? One possible avenue to arrive at an answer is to examine the collective of the way we alter the world, i.e, engineering. Engineering, then, is a way of revealing these intentions and goals. As is the case with technology, these revelations become more apparent as they advance. 

A key step in continuing this line of reasoning is recognizing that we as humans have agency over both technology and engineering. We can decide what kind of engineering we want and move towards that vision. 




technology reveal
CPS reveal + feedback ( a better goal) = mandate of engineering
