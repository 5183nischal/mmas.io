The nature of data, like nature of most things, is slippery. When charged with the task of investigating the ontology of an object, we human are good at endlessly producing the necessary properties of the object but seldom the sufficient properties. In fact, it is one of the more striking rhyme between Mathematics and Philosophy that they both investigate the necessary **and** sufficient properties of objects. But there is a way in toward the nature of data - a crack through which the light eneters. And like heroic Dante we must make the perilous journey to the very bottom to reach the Paradiso - the valley of understanding.

So, we start with quantum mechanics. Just like every other thing.

Quantum mechanics is hard, and there are many things to be said about it. I am scarcely qualified to say most of those. But an interesting distinction that once can make in Quantum mechanics is that the act of measurement itself becomes the part of the phenomene we are trying to investigate. Classically, the observer has held a strong third person view in science. The imagery is that of a cosmic movie unfolding in the screen and we, who observe, delegated to the ranks of the audience. Quantum mechanics is different. The measurements we take are themselves going to change the course of the movie. We are suddenly thurst into the screen, and our measurements into the plotline. But what is the point that I am trying to make? It is this: the theoritical model of quantum mechanics comes with mathematical objects called *operators* such as the momentum operator that appears in the famous Schroidinger's equation. And when such operators are applied to a particle, that is the act of measurement. For example when the momentum operator is applied to say an electron, we measure the momentum of the electron.

The outcome of these measurements are perhaps the most fundamental form of data. And one whose nature is perhaps easier to pindown than that of the complicated data we are used to dealing with everyday.

This data, I'd argue, is free of the many postmodernis worries that normally sorrounds data. The momentum of an electron is neither influenced by nor cares for the historical or societal context. I have heard it argued that the Units we measure with - the 'km', and 's' are themselves a product of human thought, and therefore suspectible to subjectivity. But that is akin to saying that 1km or 0.69miles changes the nature of the length of the road. It doesn't. The  further question might be: How do we define 1km? Maybe a 100 years ago that would be a sufficient rebuttal. But we have now started defining 1km purely in terms of Universal Constants - the parameters that tune the Physical world to be what it is. And like the name indicates they are universal and always constant. 

In any case, there are already enough complications introduced even at this very fundamental level. This complication is: Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle. It posits that there are related quantities that when we measure one of the quantity we fundamentally loose some precision in the measurement of the other. Remember the part about observing being the part of the plotline? We, basically, by our act of measurement interfered with the story. And the cost of this interference is the percision in measurement of this other related quantity. You have probably come across the example of this tradeoff between the measurement of position and velocity. 

The main takeaway is this: data will never be of infinite resolution. By the very act of measurement we miss out on some precision.
